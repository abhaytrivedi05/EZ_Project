# 🧠 Smart Assistant for Research Summarization

An AI-powered assistant that reads, understands, summarizes, and quizzes you on uploaded documents. Built as part of the **EZ Works GenAI Internship Assignment**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Develop an AI assistant that goes beyond keyword matching — capable of deep contextual understanding, inference, and reasoning. It supports free-form Q&A and logic-based question generation based on uploaded PDF or TXT documents.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Traditional summarizers often miss nuance. This project addresses that by providing a smart assistant that can:

- 💬 Answer comprehension and inference-based questions  
- 🎯 Generate and evaluate logic-based challenge questions  
- 🧾 Justify each response using direct references from the document

---

## 🧩 Features

- 📂 **Document Upload** (PDF/TXT support)  
- ✍️ **Auto Summary** (≤150 words) immediately after upload  
- 💬 **Ask Anything Mode** — contextual Q&A with citations  
- 🎯 **Challenge Me Mode** — logic-based question generation + answer evaluation  
- 🔒 Local-first: no API keys needed (Ollama + HuggingFace based)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Streamlit (UI)  
- Hugging Face Transformers (Q&A + Summarization)  
- Ollama (LLaMA3) for local LLMs
